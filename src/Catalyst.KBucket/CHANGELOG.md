# Release

See the [release history](https://github.com/richardschneider/k-bucket/releases) for all changes.

## Policy

The [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) policy is followed.  This means that

- Major version number is incremented on a breaking change
- Minor version number is incremented on a feature addition
- Patch version number is incremented on backwards compatibile bug fix

Major version number '0' is a special case; breaking changes can occur without incrementing 
the major version number.
